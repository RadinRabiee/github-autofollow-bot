--help               Show all available commands and options
```

## üîÑ Running in Background

### Method 1: Using nohup (Recommended)

```bash
# Run in daemon mode with nohup
nohup ./github_autofollow.py --daemon > github-bot.log 2>&1 &

# Check if it's running
ps aux | grep github_autofollow

# Monitor logs
tail -f ~/.github_autofollow.log
```

### Method 2: Using Systemd

```bash
# Install the systemd service
./github_autofollow.py --install-service

# Enable and start the service
systemctl --user enable github-autofollow.service
systemctl --user start github-autofollow.service
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

Customize the bot's behavior by editing these variables in the script:

```python
# Configuration Constants
DEFAULT_MIN_DELAY = 5           # Min seconds between actions
DEFAULT_MAX_DELAY = 15          # Max seconds between actions
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_HOUR = 50      # API rate limit protection
MIN_RUNS_PER_DAY = 7            # Min scheduled runs per day
MAX_RUNS_PER_DAY = 10           # Max scheduled runs per day
STAR_PROBABILITY = 0.7          # 70% chance to star repos
MIN_STARS = 1                   # Min repos to star per user
MAX_STARS = 3                   # Max repos to star per user
DEFAULT_MAX_USERS_PER_RUN = 15  # Users to follow per run
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- **Token Encryption**: Secure storage using PBKDF2 key derivation and Fernet encryption
- **File Permissions**: Automatic 0600 permission setting for sensitive files
- **Configurable User-Agent**: Randomized browser user-agents to avoid fingerprinting
- **Session Management**: Persistent connection handling with request timeouts
- **Exponential Backoff**: Smart retry mechanism for server errors
- **Secure Error Handling**: Exception management without exposing sensitive info

## üåê Network Growth Strategy

The bot employs a proven three-pronged approach to maximize your GitHub network growth:

1. **Target Selection**: Focuses on users with <10 followers who are likely to notice and reciprocate follows
2. **Engagement**: Stars repositories to increase follow-back probability (typically doubles the rate)
3. **Natural Pacing**: Distributes activity throughout the day to appear genuine and avoid triggers

Expected Results:
- 10-25% follow-back rate
- ~100-150 new follows per day
- ~15-30 new followers per day
- Potential for exponential growth as your profile visibility increases

## üìú Ethical Guidelines

This bot is designed for responsible use within GitHub's terms of service:

- Follows users at a reasonable, human-like pace
- Never unfollows automatically (no follow-unfollow tactics)
- Creates meaningful interactions through repository starring
- Helps undiscovered developers gain visibility
- Operates transparently with detailed logs
